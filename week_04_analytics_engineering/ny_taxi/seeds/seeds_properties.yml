      description: >
        Taxi zones roughly based on New York City's Department of City Planning Neighborhood 
        Tabulation Areas (NTAs) and are meant to approximate neighborhoods, so you can see which
        neighborhood a passenger was picked up in, and which neighborhood they dropped off in.
        Includes associated service zone (EWR, Boro Zone, Yellow Zone).
